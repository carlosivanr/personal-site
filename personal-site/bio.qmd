My name is Carlos Rodriguez, and I serve as a Senior Instructor in the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. In this role, I develop and maintain reproducible data pipelines, conduct statistical analyses, and provide data-driven support for a wide range of academic research projects, particularly in primary care and health services research.

I hold a Ph.D. in Psychology with a concentration in Behavioral Neuroscience, and I completed postdoctoral training in functional neuroimaging. My graduate research focused on understanding how prenatal alcohol exposure impacts brain network connectivity. I also explored the application of machine learning techniques to identify non-invasive biomarkers for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders using fMRI data.

In addition to my professional work, I am deeply committed to advancing diversity in science. I have mentored students from historically underrepresented backgrounds through initiatives led by the Society for Neuroscience, the University of New Mexicoâ€™s El Centro de la Raza, and the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), supporting their progress toward careers in biomedical and behavioral research.
